      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">Why a Forest in Duxbury?</h1>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Duxbury was once a vibrant farming town. For over 200 years, this land produced food, sustained families, and nourished a community grounded in local resilience.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        But like much of rural America, industrialization and suburban expansion changed everything. Fields became lawns. Orchards became developments. The deep relationship between land and life was fractured.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Today, Duxbury has the opportunity to remember â€” and to reimagine.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">The Vision: A Living Healing System</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        We are planting a 100-acre syntropic food forest â€” a regenerative system that heals soil, captures water, sequesters carbon, and feeds both body and spirit.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        This forest isnâ€™t ornamental. Itâ€™s functional. It provides:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4">
        <li>Fresh food for local people</li>
        <li>Medicinal herbs for healing</li>
        <li>Natural learning spaces for youth</li>
        <li>Vocational paths in land-based livelihoods</li>
        <li>Carbon capture and biodiversity renewal</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Why Now?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Because the climate is changing. Because isolation and burnout are rising. Because we need sanctuaries of reconnection â€” with nature, each other, and our purpose.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Duxbury can be a prototype. A spark. A living classroom for ecological healing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Why You?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Because forests are not funded by governments. They are co-created by visionaries, rebels, and caretakers who dare to plant something they may never fully harvest.
