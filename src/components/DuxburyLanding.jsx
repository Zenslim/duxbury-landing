          This land was once a thriving agricultural community. Today, its soil lies mostly dormant, and its peopleâ€”like so manyâ€”are seeking reconnection.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-6 text-gray-700">
          We are planting a 100-acre syntropic food forest. Not to return to the pastâ€”but to create a living system that regenerates soil, water, food, spirit, and future.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-6 text-gray-700">
          This is not a project. Itâ€™s a prayer of resilience. A sanctuary. A spark. 
          You donâ€™t donate to a forest. You become part of it.
